# Merge System


First Look a demo Scene
System GameObject - Must be there with PointGenerator
CellContainer for with :
Points Drag Controller
Monster Container
PointsContainer

MonsterPool should contain every Scriptable Object
And every Scriptable object should have link on a gameObject of Merged things


Merge Works only with android combined with Unity Remote 5

There must be 3 layers:
1.Monster - things to merge
2.Floor - floor on which "Monsters" can be draggable and merged
3.Cell or Point - the place points for "Monsters"

Assign them to "Points Drag Controller" script
